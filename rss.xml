				<p>This is the first monthly update on blog post for Neer Games. This month has been good for Neer Games, people have joined and games have slowly progressed. Unfortunately these updates is the only way to see the progress of the fangames and clones being developed -- because, well, copyright infringement.</p>
				<p>So far, the Ben 10 fangame has been the only game to make any progress worth mentioning. Currently there is only a dysfunctional menu. Here's a screenshot of the Ben 10 game's menu:</p>

					<p>Dysfunctional, because the menu buttons actually don't work yet (I'm working on it!), though progress is progress no matter how small.</p>
					<p>So what's next? So far the main games being developed by Neer Games is a Ben 10 fangame, a Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective clone, and eventually Neer's own original game. There's some things I didn't mention, but it's enough to get the idea. At some point there will be an XMPP chat server for Neer Games, and possibly a forum.</p>
